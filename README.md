# crypto_trader

Flutter application for crypto-trading. Specialized for iOS.

### Status

**Feature complete**

## Motivation

Coinbase Pro is insufficient

* Super janky on iPhone
    * Not very user-friendly on desktop either
* Doesn't offer automatic dollar cost averaging (DCA) as a service

### I couldn't find any app meeting the following requirements (in 2021)

Similar to M1 finance, in that one assembles an idealized portfolio, and he app periodically
adds money to resemble that portfolio (aka "passive rebalancing").

## Features

* Deposit button
* Trade button that automatically buys in your most under-funded account
* Show your total earnings (and as percentage of total holdings)
