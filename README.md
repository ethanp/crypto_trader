# crypto_trader

Flutter application for crypto-trading. Specialized for iOS.

### Status

**Feature complete**

## Motivation

Coinbase Pro is insufficient

* Super janky on iPhone
    * Not very user-friendly on desktop either
* Doesn't offer automatic dollar cost averaging (DCA) as a service

### I couldn't find any app meeting the following requirements (in 2021)

* I want a similar to M1 finance
    * I assemble an idealized portfolio
    * The app periodically adds money to resemble that portfolio
        * Aka "passive rebalancing"

## Features

* Deposit button
* Trade button that automatically buys in your most under-funded account
* Show your total earnings (and as percentage of total holdings)
