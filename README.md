# crypto_trader

Multiplatform application for crypto-trading.

Tested on iOS and MacOS. Should also work on Linux, Windows, and Android.

## Motivation

Coinbase Pro app is super janky on mobile. They don't allow automatic dollar cost averaging (DCA).

I couldn't find any good DeFi startups or bots on github that work like I want. I want a similar
model to M1 finance. I assemble an idealized portfolio, and the app takes my money and does its best
to resemble that portfolio (aka passive rebalancing).

## Features

* Deposit button
* Trade button that automatically buys in your most under-funded account
* Show your total earnings (and as percentage of total holdings)

## Future work

* Portfolio performance analysis?
