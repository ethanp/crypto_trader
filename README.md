Utilities for crpyto trading

## Motivation

Coinbase Pro is difficult to use. The app is super janky on both web
and mobile. They don't allow automatic dollar cost averaging (DCA).

Another app I'm using (**TODO** what) only allows DCA on Bitcoin.

I couldn't find any good bots on github that work like I want. I want
a similar model to M1 finance. I assemble an idealized portfolio, and
the app takes my money and does its best to resemble that portfolio
(aka passive rebalancing).

## MVP

* Click a button to use funds from checking account to purchase ETH

## Future work

* Create "idealized" portfolio
* Utilize incoming funds to move towards the idealized portfolio
* Portfolio performance analysis
